<h1># RileyBot</h1>
Omnipotent and incompetent. The first true AI.

Unless stated otherwise code in this project was written by Riley Bowling, the creator of RileyBot.

<h2>RileyBot is built to work with the Telegram chat client, it uses this great telegram api wrapper for python:
https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot</h2>

---

botspeak.mp3, botspeak.wav and temp.wav are temporarily generated files used for the /speak command, they
should be added to a .gitignore that someone should make

memory.txt contains all of the bots memories, words read and stored randomly from a specific group chat stream over like years, 
do not delete but consider the idea of seperate memory files for advanced recollection :^O

rileybbot.py contains all the convoluted logic of RileyBot, his very soul
