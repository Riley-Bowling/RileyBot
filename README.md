botspeak.mp3, botspeak.wav and temp.wav are temporarily generated files used for the /speak command, they
should be added to a .gitignore that someone should make

memory.txt contains all of the bots memories, words read and stored randomly from a specific group chat stream over like years, 
do not delete but consider the idea of seperate memory files for advanced recollection :^O

rileybbot.py contains all the convoluted logic of RileyBot, his very soul
